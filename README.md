Library Management and Loan System


Hello everyone, this is my TCC from ETEC, the project was developed from the need for a more efficient control of the Library that did not have any system,
with this generating lack of access to information that enters and leaves the sector, thus generated in many difficulties in its management.

The software's main functionalities to remedy the problems pointed out are Registration, difference, Listing and Archiving of Books, 
Users (students, teachers, etc.), Loans, Events (events that occur in the library) and Goals (books to be taken in a time frame).

Console.WriteLine(Hi Mom);  :)
